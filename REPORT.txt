Basic Ray-Tracer

Part a. - Sang-Ah Han
Ray casting code is in raytracer.cpp. We take the image plane and convert it to
world space = i. Then we take the ray's direction that convert it to world space
= d. The resulting ray begins at i and goes n direction d.

Part b. - Sang-Ah Han
Intersection for ray-square code is in scene_object.cpp. We convert the ray's
origin and direction to object space. We assume that it's a unit square (width
1, centered at origin). If we find that its t-value tells us there is an
intersection that is in front of the ray, we set it that point to be the ray's
intersection. We used the pseudo-code from tutorial to write our code.

Part c. - Sang-Ah Han
Intersection for ray-sphere code is in scene_object.cpp. We convert the ray's
origin and direction to object space. We assume that it's a unit sphere (radius
1, centered at origin). We use the quadratic formula to find the sphere's
t-values. If we find that its t-value tells us there is an intersection that is
in front of the ray, we set it that point to be the ray's intersection. We found
the a, b, c values (quadratic formula) from the online notes on the course
website.

Part d. - Li Wan & Sang-Ah Han
Phong shading code is in light_source.cpp. We used the lecture slides' guide to
find the values for diffuse, specular and ambient colours, and added them all
together to produce Phong shading.

Advanced Ray Tracer -- found in /extended folder.
The renders for the advanced ray tracer use a more enlarged plane than the
basic version. The renders for each individual feature listed can be found in
the same folder, with prefix 'render_'. The renders for the final ray tracer are
render_all{1,2,3}.bmp, and can be obtained by running ./raytracer all


Specular reflections - Sang-Ah Han
Reflection code is in raytracer.cpp, in the shadeRay function. We used notes from
tutorial and from the textbook to construct a "reflection ray". If there was an
intersection with the "reflection ray", then we added shadeRay(REFLECTION RAY)
* DAMP FACTOR to the intersection's colour, where DAMP FACTOR is a factor based
on the distance of the intersection.
- Run: ./raytracer reflect
- Look for "TODO: REFLECTION"
- Renders: render_reflect{1,2,3}.bmp

Shadows - Sang-Ah Han
Similarly to the specular reflections, we used tutorial notes and textbook notes
to construct a "shadow ray". If there was an intersection with the "reflection
ray", then we added 0.5 * the intersection's colour to the intersection's colour
(to make it darker). This is done in raytracer.cpp's Raytracer::computeShading.
- Run: ./raytracer shadow
- Look for "TODO: SHADOWS"
- Renders: render_shadow{1,2,3}.bmp

Anti-aliasing - Sang-Ah Han
Code for anti-aliasing is found in raytracer.cpp's Raytracer::render. We used
notes from http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/CS211B/RayTracing%20tutorial.pdf to
change the ray construction loop, so that the resulting colour is an average of
4 samples. Looking at the renders, we can see that the lines around the sphere are
much smoother than in the renders for the Shadows feature.
- Run: ./raytracer antialias
- Look for "TODO: ANTIALIAS"
- Renders: render_antialias{1,2,3}.bmp

Soft shadows - Sang-Ah Han
We replace the shadow code with soft shadow code in raytracer.cpp's function
Raytracer::computeShading. Instead of looking for one ray, we cast multiple rays
that are at a "jittered" position (a random position near the original ray's
position).  If these rays intersect, then we also half the original ray.
- Run: ./raytracer softshadow
- Look for "TODO: SOFT SHADOW"
- Renders: render_softshadow{1,2,3}.bmp -- using 30 rays

Glossy reflection - Sang-Ah Han
We replace the reflection code with soft shadow code in raytracer.cpp's function
Raytracer::shadeRay. Instead of looking for one ray, we cast multiple rays
that are at a "jittered" position (a random position near the original ray's
position).  If these rays intersect, then we also multiply the original ray by
the damp factor.
- Run: ./raytracer glossyreflect
- Look for "TODO: GLOSSY REFLECT"
- Renders: render_glossyreflect{1,2,3}.bmp -- using 4 rays
