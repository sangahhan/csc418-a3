Basic Ray-Tracer

Part a. - Sang-Ah Han
Ray casting code is in raytracer.cpp. We take the image plane and convert it to
world space = i. Then we take the ray's direction that convert it to world space
= d. The resulting ray begins at i and goes n direction d.

Part b. - Sang-Ah Han
Intersection for ray-square code is in scene_object.cpp. We convert the ray's
origin and direction to object space. We assume that it's a unit square (width
1, centered at origin). If we find that its t-value tells us there is an
intersection that is in front of the ray, we set it that point to be the ray's
intersection. We used the pseudo-code from tutorial to write our code.

Part c. - Sang-Ah Han
Intersection for ray-sphere code is in scene_object.cpp. We convert the ray's
origin and direction to object space. We assume that it's a unit sphere (radius
1, centered at origin). We use the quadratic formula to find the sphere's
t-values. If we find that its t-value tells us there is an intersection that is
in front of the ray, we set it that point to be the ray's intersection. We found
the a, b, c values (quadratic formula) from the online notes on the course
website.

Part d. - Li Wan & Sang-Ah Han
Phong shading code is in light_source.cpp. We used the lecture slides' guide to
find the values for diffuse, specular and ambient colours, and added them all
together to produce Phong shading.

Advanced Ray Tracer -- found in /extended folder.
The renders for the advanced ray tracer use a more enlarged plane than the
basic version. The renders for each individual feature listed can be found in
the same folder, with prefix 'render_'. The renders for the final ray tracer are
render_all{1,2,3}.bmp, and can be obtained by running ./raytracer all


Specular reflections - Sang-Ah Han
Reflection code is in raytracer.cpp, in the shadeRay function. We used notes from
tutorial and from the textbook to construct a "reflection ray". If there was an
intersection with the "reflection ray", then we added shadeRay(REFLECTION RAY)
* DAMP FACTOR to the intersection's colour, where DAMP FACTOR is a factor based
on the distance of the intersection.
- Run: ./raytracer reflect
- Look for "TODO: REFLECTION"
- Renders: render_reflect{1,2,3}.bmp

Shadows - Sang-Ah Han
Similarly to the specular reflections, we used tutorial notes and textbook notes
to construct a "shadow ray". If there was an intersection with the "reflection
ray", then we added 0.5 * the intersection's colour to the intersection's colour
(to make it darker). This is done in raytracer.cpp's Raytracer::computeShading.
- Run: ./raytracer shadow
- Look for "TODO: SHADOWS"
- Renders: render_shadow{1,2,3}.bmp

Anti-aliasing - Sang-Ah Han
Code for anti-aliasing is found in raytracer.cpp's Raytracer::render. We used
notes from http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/CS211B/RayTracing%20tutorial.pdf to
change the ray construction loop, so that the resulting colour is an average of
4 samples. Looking at the renders, we can see that the lines around the sphere are
much smoother than in the renders for the Shadows feature.
- Run: ./raytracer antialias
- Look for "TODO: ANTIALIAS"
- Renders: render_antialias{1,2,3}.bmp

Soft shadows - Sang-Ah Han
We replace the shadow code with soft shadow code in raytracer.cpp's function
Raytracer::computeShading. Instead of looking for one ray, we cast multiple rays
that are at a "jittered" position (a random position near the original ray's
position).  If these rays intersect, then we also half the original ray.
- Run: ./raytracer softshadow
- Look for "TODO: SOFT SHADOW"
- Renders: render_softshadow{1,2,3}.bmp -- using 30 rays

Glossy reflection - Sang-Ah Han
We replace the reflection code with soft shadow code in raytracer.cpp's function
Raytracer::shadeRay. Instead of looking for one ray, we cast multiple rays
that are at a "jittered" position (a random position near the original ray's
position).  If these rays intersect, then we also multiply the original ray by
the damp factor.
- Run: ./raytracer glossyreflect
- Look for "TODO: GLOSSY REFLECT"
- Renders: render_glossyreflect{1,2,3}.bmp -- using 4 rays

Cylinder - Li Wan
We added code to detect intersections with cylinders in scene_object.cpp.
We first find intersections around the cylinder wall. Then we checked for
intersections at the cylinder caps. The cylinder is drawn with the same material
as the sphere.
- Run: ./raytracer cylinder
- Look for "TODO: CYLINDER"
- Renders: render_cylinder{1,2,3}.bmp


Texture mapping - Li Wan
We use a global buffer for R, G, and B values for the image. The image's RGB
values are loaded into the proper buffer. Then we find the x,y pixel for each
point on the object we map to (the sphere) and set the colour of the ray that
intersects the object to be equal to the colour on the image.
- Run: ./raytracer texture
- Look for "TODO: texture"
- Renders: render_texture{1,2,3}.bmp
